# Filtering-Menu

An idea for an interactive/filtering menu; initial idea will be for tea.

There will be a backend form for inputting new teas into the menu.

The backend will update a database.json file that is in turn sent to the frontend.

Frontend will be hosted on codepen and will filter selections based on brand, taste, type, caffeine, etc.
